# Django Cognito Authentication
The intent of this library is to provide a package that supports Django and allows an easy implementation for replacing the default Django authentication with an AWS Cognito based authentication.

This is a fork of [Alex Plants](https://github.com/Olorin92) great work with the original [django-cognito](https://github.com/Olorin92/django_cognito).
